# Excel_Sales_Project_Dashboard

This repository contains a Sales Dashboard created as part of a guided project to demonstrate data visualization and analysis using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard offers insights into sales performance across various regions, delivery persons, and top customers. It provides interactive filters to analyze data effectively.

## Features

### Region-wise Sales Analysis
   - Visual representation of sales performance across regions:
     - South West
     - South East
     - North West
     - North East
     - Central
   - Displays total sales in each region.

### Top Ten Customers
   - Bar chart highlighting the top 10 customers based on total sales.

### Total Sales Trend
   - Line chart showing monthly sales trends over multiple years (2021 and 2022).
   - Easy to track sales patterns over time.

### Sales by Delivery Person
   - Stacked bar chart showing sales performance for each delivery person across regions.

### Interactive Filters

     - **Year:** Choose between multiple years (e.g., 2021, 2022).
     - **Delivery Person:** View sales by individual delivery persons (e.g., Mahesh, Nilesh, Raj, etc.).
     - **Region:** Drill down into sales for specific regions.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Excel File**

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data visualization in Excel using charts (bar charts, line charts, stacked bar charts).
- Creation of dynamic dashboards with slicers for interactive filtering.
- Analysis of sales data across multiple dimensions (region, delivery person, customer).

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time data updates for dynamic dashboards.
- Add more advanced visualizations using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
- Expand analysis to include profitability and customer retention metrics.
